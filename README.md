# Cryptostats

This package is intended to be a lightweight wrapper for getting data from various APIs regarding cryptocurrencies in Go. So far, only [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com) has been implemented, but it should be fairly straightforward to add new APIs.  

I wrote this package mainly for practice writing Go rather than intending to do anything with the resulting data, but I may use it for another project down the road.
